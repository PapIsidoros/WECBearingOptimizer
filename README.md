# wave_surge_bearing_optimizer
Optimises bearing dimensions for a wave energy converter

This MATLAB script is designed to work together with MATLAB's App Designer through a GUI. The heat model uses the FTCS scheme (for now)
for transient heat calculations. Clone the repository and open up the .mlapp file using MATLAB (please make sure you have downloaded the 
app designer add-on). This should open up the GUI from where you can change the parameters of the bearing's optimization.

For more information about the wave converter's overall system please refer to: https://www.slideshare.net/varunkumar240/oyster-wave-energy-converter
